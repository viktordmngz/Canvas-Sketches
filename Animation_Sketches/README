These are all the sketches I tried out before finally reaching one I liked (which is also included here)
They are not sorted in chronological order so I do apologize.
The raw code files will reveal what I tried to do first and what was removed/tweaked.

Feel free to download the HTML/JS pairs and tweak them to your heart's content.

For me to run these, I had to shrink my window down to half-pane view. Bigger screens will have trouble viewing the animations as intended so tweak the sizing if you need to.

Other than that, enjoy these animations!
