In order to run the JS file, first download the JSON files which can be found on the main page of this repository.
Also, make sure to download all the files to the same directory.

The Tweakpane import on grid-sketch.js will give you a parse error that looks like this:
ParseError: 'import' and 'export' may appear only with 'sourceType: module'

I have personally not figured out how to correct this error as it involves changing a global setting in the
configurations and when I tried to find out where this was, I was unable to. I would encourage you, the smarter
people, to look into fixing it and maybe letting me know how you did it. Here is a link to one of the many sources

Run the following code within the Command Prompt/Terminal:

canvas-sketch --open circles_and_lines.js

This should open the animation in a browser. If it does not, try installing Node.js and rerunning the command.
======================================================================================================================================
Be sure to install Node.js in the same directory that you download these files to.
To install Node.js, visit their website and choose the distribution for your OS.

Then, run the following commands:
npm install canvas-sketch-cli --global
npm install canvas-sketch-util --save

The first command will install the command canvas-sketch-cli to your command terminal and allow you to run Canvas from the terminal.
The second command will install the utilities needed within the files like Math and Random.

These animations are a part of a course on Domestika called "Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript" by Bruno Imbrizi.
