In order to run the JS file, first download the JSON files.
Also, make sure to download all the files to the same directory.

Run the following code within the Command Prompt/Terminal:

canvas-sketch --open circles_and_lines.js

This should open the animation in a browser. If it does not, try installing Node.js and rerunning the command.
======================================================================================================================================
Be sure to install Node.js in the same directory that you download these files to.
To install Node.js, visit their website and choose the distribution for your OS.

Then, run the following commands:
npm install canvas-sketch-cli --global
npm install canvas-sketch-util --save

The first command will install the command canvas-sketch-cli to your command terminal and allow you to run Canvas from the terminal.
The second command will install the utilities needed within the files like Math and Random.
======================================================================================================================================
These animations are a part of a course on Domestika called "Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript" by Bruno Imbrizi.
