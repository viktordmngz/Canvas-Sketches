In order to run the JS file, first download the JSON files.

Run the following code within the Command Prompt/Terminal:

canvas-sketch --open circles_and_lines.js

This should open the animation in a browser. If it does not, try installing Node.js and rerunning the command.

This animation was part of a tutorial course on Domestika called "Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript" by Bruno Imbrizi.
If you need any other information, try the course or reaching out to Mr. Imbrizi.

Enjoy.
